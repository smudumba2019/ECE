I took this course in Spring 2021 semester at Purdue University.

Couple of skills I learned in this course:
1. **Coding Competency** in _Object Oriented Programming_, especially in Python. This skill can also be easily applied to any other programming language such as MATLAB.
2. **Systematic debugging:** finding the root cause issues and fixing them, especially in large script files that depend on many functions, which depend on other functions, in what I call _function-of-functions_, can be tedious and strenuous. For me, having the patience and clear-mindedness is really important. So, I mostly do debugging work in the mornings, when I have both patience and a fresh mind. This strategy seems to have been successful so far.
3. **There's always an answer to your problem on the internet!** So, don't waste time, start searching!
4. When I code large scripts, I usually abstract out the problem or tasks into smaller and smaller functions. I create a test script to test the code with simpler instances before I implement into the larger code. I do this mainly to not overwhelm myself with the huge tasks.
5. Preparing datasets is tedious and annotating them manually is extremely laborous. But it do be like that. It is the most important component of training a ML or DL model. So get this process right!
6. Fundamentally, ML and DL are not super challenging topics to understand, but architecting a model is the most difficult part. The important areas in this field are Data collection for training, Optimization (for minimizing the loss function), Testing on unseen data.
