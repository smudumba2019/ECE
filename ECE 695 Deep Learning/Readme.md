I took this course in Spring 2021 semester at Purdue University.

Couple of skills I learned in this course:
1. **Coding Competency** in _Object Oriented Programming_, especially in Python. This skill can also be easily applied to any other programming language such as MATLAB.
2. **Systematic debugging:** finding the root cause issues and fixing them, especially in large script files that depend on many functions, which depend on other functions, in what I call _function-of-functions_, can be tedious and strenuous. For me, having the patience and clear-mindedness is really important. So, I mostly do debugging work in the mornings, when I have both patience and a fresh mind. This strategy seems to have been successful so far.
3. **There's always an answer to your problem on the internet!** So, don't waste time, start searching!
4. Preparing datasets is tedious and annotating them manually is extremely laborous. But it do be like that. It is the most important component of training a ML or DL model. So get this process right!
5. Fundamentally, ML and DL are not super challenging topics to understand, but architecting a model is the most difficult part. The important areas in this field are Data collection for training, Optimization (for minimizing the loss function), Testing on unseen data.
