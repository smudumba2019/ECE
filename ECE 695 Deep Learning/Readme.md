I took this course in Spring 2021 semester at Purdue University.

Couple of skills I learned in this course:
1. Coding Competency: especially Object Oriented Programming in Python. Debugging is life and it's okay if the code doesn't work right away. There's always some solution to issues in Stackoverflow or other online forums.
2. Preparing datasets is tedious and annotating them manually is extremely laborous. But it is the most important component of training. So get this right!
3. 
4. Fundamentally, ML and DL are inverse functions (given y, find x)
